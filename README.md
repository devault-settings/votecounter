# votecounter

A ranked pairs vote counting code compatible with google forms.

This code is adapted from a votecounting code developed for use in elections at Ricketts Hovse, one of the 8 undergraduate houses at Caltech.
It exists thanks to the contributions of Coby Abrahams, Alejandro LÃ³pez, Alison Dugas, Umesh Padia, Jack Briones, Audrey DeVault, and other Skurves.

> [!TIP]
> To make sure the code is working correctly, try running `RunTest()` . This will create and count ballots matching the Tennessee example in the [Ranked Pairs Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_pairs).

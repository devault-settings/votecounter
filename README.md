# votecounter

A ranked pairs vote counting code compatible with google forms.

This code is adapted from a votecounting code developed for use in elections at Ricketts Hovse, one of the 8 undergraduate houses at Caltech.
It exists thanks to the contributions of Coby Abrahams, Alejandro LÃ³pez, Alison Dugas, Umesh Padia, Jack Briones, Audrey DeVault, and other Skurves.

The winner should be Nashville and the graphical representation should look like this, with arrows pointing to the losers:
